KD Tree backed IP Proximity Search
Gives you K nearest neighbors based on the distance 
between IP address blocks. Seems to be working 
reasonably well.

Ideally this would be a simplified fast alternative to geolocation
The Geo Coordinates in the location.json file are there to measure accuracy

```
npm install

node index.js
```
